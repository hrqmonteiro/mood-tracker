# What do you think are the greatest areas of risk in completing the project?

- Ensure end-to-end type safety between the API and the frontend
- Dockerize the app and make sure the separate containers are able to communicate between one another

# What changes/additions would you make to the design?

- Add a fallback component in case no logged records come from the database and exhibit in the Sidebar and Mood component
- Add a toast for when the request are made to the API and return loading, success and/or false

# List two or three things that you would consider implementing in the future that would add significant value to the project.

- Authentication
- User differentiation
- Caching and revalidation

# Are there any clarifying questions you would ask?

- No questions from me besides those points above
